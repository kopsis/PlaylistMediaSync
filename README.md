PlaylistMediaSync
=================

One-way iTunes playlist to filesystem folder synchronization.

This tool provides a simple way to keep a filesystem folder (such as a mounted memory card or USB flash drive) synchronized with an iTunes playlist. The sync is one-way -- the contents of the destination folder will be modified to match the selected iTunes playlist.

WARNING! Files/directories in the destination folder that are not part of the selected iTunes playlist will be deleted. Always select a destination folder that is empty or only contains the contents of a previous sync.
